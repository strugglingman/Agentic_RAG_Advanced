"""
DTOs - Data Transfer Objects

DTOs for transferring data between layers:
- chat.py         → ChatRequest, ChatResponse
- conversation.py → ConversationDTO
- file.py         → FileDTO
- context.py      → RAGContext

Note: These are different from domain entities.
DTOs are for API input/output, entities are for business logic.
